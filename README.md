## Wantsome - Project X

 - This is a __template__ for the final project at the end of Java course.
   It's just a basic working gradle project, with common libraries included.

 - __IMPORTANT__: after you finish your project, you should replace this
   content with something more relevant for your specific project. 
   
   It should contain: 
   - short description, the __purpose and scope__ of your project
   - __initial setup instructions__ (init db, others?)
   - __usage instructions__
   - interesting __technical details__ about how you built it (libs used, db, etc)
   
   For nicer formatting you may using __MarkDown syntax__, see guide:
